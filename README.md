A Shiny app that is a learning tool for removing outliers in time series.  The app allows the user to choose a model (e.g. LOESS, moving median, moving average) and set its parameters, in order to observe the effect these changes have on the fit of the model both graphically (in time series and residual plots) and in the root mean squared error (RMSE).

Please find the app [here](https://carolyn.shinyapps.io/loess/).
